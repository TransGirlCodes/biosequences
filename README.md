# biosequences

*A simple C++ library for working with
biological sequences using an efficient representation.*

The design of biological sequences in this library
is deliberately based on the design of various types and methods
in BioJulia/BioSequences.jl.

I have deliberately tried to to use the more modern
C++ features and styles for this library.
