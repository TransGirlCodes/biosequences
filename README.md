# biosequences

*A simple C++ library for working with
biological sequences using an efficient representation.*

The design of biological sequences in this library
is deliberately based on the design of various types and methods
in [BioJulia/BioSequences.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/BioSequences.jl).

In the future I intent to make this library compatible with the BioJulia
package it is based on.

Shameless plug: If you want to do some biology scripts in a high level yet 
performant language, go and check out the BioJulia packages for the julia
language. 

I have deliberately tried to to use the more modern
C++ features and styles for this library.
